= 8-bit breadboard computer Kit 1: Clock
Jordan Noone <jordan@embedded.ventures>
v==0, 2021-05-09

You’re going to be building the clock that controls the timing within your computer. You’re actually going to build three clocks, each with a 555 timer at its core, but each will be wired in a unique way. You’re going to add logic blocks in a way that allows you to switch between which clock is controlling your computer.

===	Breadboard
====	Start with a breadboard. We will referrer to the horizontal connections as “rows” and the vertical connections as “columns”.

===	Timer Circuit
====	Get a 555 timer and note which side has the small circular indent. This side is the “top”. The 555 timer is labeled “LM555CN”.

====	Using a jumper, connect pin 4 to power
====	Using a jumper, connect pin 6 to pin ==
====	Using a ==01 microfarad capacitor, connect pin 5 to ground.
====	Using a ==0 microfarad capacitor, connect pin 2 (long leg) to ground (short leg).
====	Place a potentiometer nearby on the board.
====	Using a 1,000 ohm resistor, connect 555 pin 7 to potentiometer pin 2
====	Using a jumper, connect the 555 pin 6 to the potentiometer pin 1
===	Indicator LED

====	In the bottom right corner of the board:
=====	Place the long leg of a blue LED into its own column.
=====	Place the short leg into a nearby column.
=====	Connect a 220 ohm resistor between the short leg’s column and ground.
=====	Connect pin 3 of this 555 timer to the long leg of the LED.
===	Power Stabilizers
[#img-power-stabilizers]
.Schematic: Power Stabilizers
image::https://raw.githubusercontent.com/EmbeddedVentures/8-bit_computer_instructions/master/Kit%201/images/stabilizers.png[Power Stabilizers] 
====	Get two ==1 micro-Farad capacitors and connect them both from power to ground.
===	Power
====	Connect the power row on the top of the board to the power row on the bottom of the board using a jumper.
====	Connect the ground row on the bottom of the board to the ground row on the bottom of the board using a jumper.
====	Connect two jumpers to the power adapter using a small phillips screwdriver. Tighten very lightly.
====	Connect the two jumpers to the the board (positive to positive, negative to negative)
====	Connect the power adapter to the power cord 
====	Plug the power cord into a standard outlet
===	Test the first clock
====	The clock should be running as soon as power is connected. The LED should be blinking.
====	Adjusting the potentiometer will adjust the clock speed. Gently adjust it and the LED should blink slower or faster.
===	Disconnect power
====	Before building the rest of the board, unplug the power cable from the outlet.
===	Remove the clock output line
====	One line that you added in was temporary just to test this part. Remove the line between the pin 3 of this 555 timer and the LED.

===	Power
====	Plug the power cord into a standard outlet
===	Test the second clock
====	When power is plugged in, the LED should be off.
====	When you push the switch, the LED should momentarily turn on.
====	Regardless of the duration you hold down the switch, the duration the LED stays on should be the same.
