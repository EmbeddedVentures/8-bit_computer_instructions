= 8-bit breadboard computer Kit 2: Registers and ALU
Jessie Frazelle <jessie@embedded.ventures>
v1.0, 2021-05-05

Youâ€™re going to be building the storage for bits of data for the computer.

Based on videos here: https://eater.net/8bit/registers and https://eater.net/8bit/alu 

== Registers

For the A and B registers, we will use red LEDs and for the instruction register we will use blue and yellow LEDs. The A and B registers will be built on the left side of the breadboard and the intruction register will be built on the right side of the breadboard. This is so that things line up better for the full computer.

=== A register

==== Power wires

* Start with a clean breadboard
* At the far right side of the breadboard (numbers like 60) connect the two sides of **ground (-)** to each other with a wire.
* At the far right side of the breadboard (numbers like 60) connect the two sides of **power (+)** to each other with a wire.

==== Place our chips

* Place the **74LS245 8-bit bus transceiver** on the far left side of the board (number like 3) in the middle of the board such that the two sides are in E and F slots.
* Place the **74LS173 4-bit D register** on the left side of our first chip (number like 15) in the middle of the board such that the two sides are in E and F slots.
* Place another **74LS173 4-bit D register** on the left side of the first D register chip (number like 25) in the middle of the board such that the two sides are in E and F slots.

==== Place our LEDs

* Select 8 red LEDs
* Place the 8 LEDs on the bottom of the board going from **ground (-)** to **A**, they should be side by side along this row, you can start at the number 15 and go to about 35 with the 8 LEDs

==== Wire the 8-bit bus transceiver

=== B Register

Use the same instructions for the A register and repeat for the B register. This register is the exact same as the A register.

=== Instruction register
