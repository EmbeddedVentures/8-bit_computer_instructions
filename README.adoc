= 8-bit breadboard computer Kit 2: Registers and ALU
Jessie Frazelle <jessie@embedded.ventures>
v1.0, 2021-05-05

Youâ€™re going to be building the storage for bits of data for the computer.

Based on videos here: https://eater.net/8bit/registers and https://eater.net/8bit/alu 

== Registers

For the A and B registers, we will use red LEDs and for the instruction register we will use blue and yellow LEDs. The A and B registers will be built on the left side of the breadboard and the intruction register will be built on the right side of the breadboard. This is so that things line up better for the full computer.

=== A register

==== Power wires

Start with a clean breadboard

===== Connect ground

At the far right side of the breadboard (numbers like 60) connect the two sides of **ground (-)** to each other with a wire.

===== Connect power

At the far right side of the breadboard (numbers like 60) connect the two sides of **power (+)** to each other with a wire.

==== Place our chips

===== 74LS245 8-bit bus transceiver

Place the **74LS245 8-bit bus transceiver** on the far left side of the board (number like **3**) in the middle of the board such that the two sides are in **E** and **F** slots.

===== 74LS173 4-bit D register (1)

Place the first  **74LS173 4-bit D register** on the left side of our first chip (number like **15**) in the middle of the board such that the two sides are in **E** and **F** slots.

===== 74LS173 4-bit D register (2)

Place the second **74LS173 4-bit D register** on the left side of the first D register chip (number like **25**) in the middle of the board such that the two sides are in **E** and **F** slots.

==== Place our LEDs

Select 8 red LEDs.

===== LED (1)

The first LED needs to go from **ground (-)** to **pin 3 (Q1)** of the first **74LS173 4-bit D register**

===== LED (2)

The second LED needs to go from **ground (-)** to **pin 4 (Q2)** of the first **74LS173 4-bit D register**

===== LED (3)

The third LED needs to go from **ground (-)** to **pin 5 (Q3)** of the first **74LS173 4-bit D register**

===== LED (4)

The fourth LED needs to go from **ground (-)** to **pin 6 (Q4)** of the first **74LS173 4-bit D register**

===== LED (5)

The fifth LED needs to go from **ground (-)** to **pin 3 (Q1)** of the second **74LS173 4-bit D register**

===== LED (6)

The sixth LED needs to go from **ground (-)** to **pin 4 (Q2)** of the second **74LS173 4-bit D register**

===== LED (7)

The seventh LED needs to go from **ground (-)** to **pin 5 (Q3)** of the second **74LS173 4-bit D register**

===== LED (8)

The eigth LED needs to go from **ground (-)** to **pin 6 (Q4)** of the second **74LS173 4-bit D register**

==== Connect power and ground for the chips

===== 74LS245 8-bit bus transceiver

* Connect **pin 1 (DIR)** to **power (+)** --> `+ to A`
* Connect **pin 20 (+5v)** to **power (+)** --> `+ to J`
* Connect **pin 10 (GND)** to **ground (-)** --> `- to A`

===== 74LS173 4-bit D register (1)

** Connect **pin 2 (N)** to **pin 1 (M)** --> `B to B`
* Connect **pin 8 (GND)** to **ground (-)** --> `- to A`
* Connect **pin 16 (+5v)** to **power (+)** --> `+ to J`

===== 74LS173 4-bit D register (2)

* Connect **pin 1 (M)** to **ground (-)** --> `- to A`
** Connect **pin 2 (N)** to **pin 1 (M)** --> `B to B`
* Connect **pin 8 (GND)** to **ground (-)** --> `- to A`
* Connect **pin 16 (+5v)** to **power (+)** --> `+ to J`

==== Connect CLR for the two 74LS173 4-bit D registers

Connect **pin 15 (CLR)** of the first **74LS173 4-bit D register** to **pin 15 (CLR)** of the second **74LS173 4-bit D register** --> `J to J`

Use the same instructions for the A register and repeat for the B register. This register is the exact same as the A register.
