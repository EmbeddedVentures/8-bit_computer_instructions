= 8-bit breadboard computer Kit 2: Registers and ALU
Jessie Frazelle <jessie@embedded.ventures>
v1.0, 2021-05-05

Youâ€™re going to be building the storage for bits of data for the computer.

Based on videos here: https://eater.net/8bit/registers and https://eater.net/8bit/alu

== Registers

For the A and B registers, we will use red LEDs and for the instruction register we will use blue and yellow LEDs. The A and B registers will be built on the left side of the breadboard and the intruction register will be built on the right side of the breadboard. This is so that things line up better for the full computer.

=== A register

==== Power wires

Start with a clean breadboard

===== Connect ground

At the far right side of the breadboard (numbers like 60) connect the two sides of *ground (-)* to each other with a wire.

===== Connect power

At the far right side of the breadboard (numbers like 60) connect the two sides of *power `+`* to each other with a wire.

==== Place our chips

===== 74LS245 8-bit bus transceiver

NOTE: The 8-bit bus transceiver allows 8-bit data from *A (pins 2-9)* to *B (pins 11-18)* or B to A depending on the input to *pin 1 (DIR)*. The input for *pin 19 (EN aka. ENABLE)* disables the device so A and B are isolated.

Place the *74LS245 8-bit bus transceiver* on the far left side of the board (number like *3*) in the middle of the board such that the two sides are in *E* and *F* slots.

===== 74LS173 4-bit D register (1)

NOTE: The 4-bit D register stores 4 bits. You write data to it by holding G~1~ and G~2~ low and pulsating the clock.

Place the first  *74LS173 4-bit D register* on the left side of our first chip (number like *15*) in the middle of the board such that the two sides are in *E* and *F* slots.

===== 74LS173 4-bit D register (2)

NOTE: The 4-bit D register stores 4 bits. You write data to it by holding G~1~ and G~2~ low and pulsating the clock.

Place the second *74LS173 4-bit D register* on the left side of the first D register chip (number like *25*) in the middle of the board such that the two sides are in *E* and *F* slots.

==== Place our LEDs

Select 8 red LEDs.

===== LED (1)

The first LED needs to go from *ground (-)* to *pin 3 (Q~1~)* of the first *74LS173 4-bit D register*

===== LED (2)

The second LED needs to go from *ground (-)* to *pin 4 (Q~2~)* of the first *74LS173 4-bit D register*

===== LED (5)

The fifth LED needs to go from *ground (-)* to *pin 3 (Q~1~)* of the second *74LS173 4-bit D register*

===== LED (6)

The sixth LED needs to go from *ground (-)* to *pin 4 (Q~2~)* of the second *74LS173 4-bit D register*

===== LED (7)

The seventh LED needs to go from *ground (-)* to *pin 5 (Q~3~)* of the second *74LS173 4-bit D register*

Use the same instructions for the A register and repeat for the B register. This register is the exact same as the A register.
